# QuickPlot

QuickPlot is an app that allows you to enter the name of any movie and uses the OpenAI API to generate a short summary of the movie. This is perfect for getting a real summary for a movie instead of the vauge, one or two sentences, that all of the streaming services provide. That does not provide any real context to the story and you end up watching about half of the movie before you realize this movie sucks. You just wasted about 45-60 minutes of your life. With is app you can see what to except from just about any movie.
